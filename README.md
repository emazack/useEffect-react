# useEffect-react
The result of this application is a list of users (retrieved from a /users endpoint) with a list of posts for each user (retrieved by calling users/[ID]/posts for each one).

## Goal
- useEffect (for initialization, and invoked when props changes)
- useState
- create lists and sub-lists
- make HTTP requests in the main component and in every child of the list
